## Getting Started

- First clone the repo

- Since the project package manager is Yarn, run the following command to get all required dependencies

```
yarn install
```

- Then run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Product Approach

For my styling I used Tailwind CSS for quick development and better subsequent maintenance
